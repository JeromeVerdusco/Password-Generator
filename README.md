# Password-Generator

Downloaded

This Challenge was truly the definition of Challenging!!

With the help of Byron, the internet examples, lots of seraching, and a TA I was able to back off the cliff edge and get something working.

I tried to use the browser character table but could not get it to produce anything.  Finally changed over to array's at the advice of the TA.  Simple For Loop and it was working after days of fustration.

Renamed the "generatePassword" in the writePassword function to "selectValues" after realizing that I started coding on my logic but not the logic that was given me.

I have my array's and variables identified globally then have the user inputs recorded.  In the same function I have one array created based on input prompts for "true" by the If statements for each var.

The For Loop then selects randomly from the created "passwordGen" array for the number of characters entered by user.  Then presents the results in the box in the browser.


I did not give my Git Hub repo a unique name but too late to change that now!
